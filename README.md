# random-proteus-sims

This is my collection of various electrical simulations. I often revisit this when I need some refreshing on basic electronics. Done in ISIS Proteus 7.10 SP0. No guarantee that these will work in other version though :)

Most microcontroller codes were done using CodevisionAVR with version 2.04 or 3.12
